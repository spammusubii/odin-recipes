        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This tastes just like your favorite Asian take-out but you can have this 
            ready faster than the time it would take to go pick up take-out! No marinade required. 
            I’ve shared other teriyaki chicken recipes like my Grilled Teriyaki Chicken 
            Bowl but this hands down beats the prep and cook time on any other teriyaki 
            chicken I’ve tried. And yet it tastes just as good! Plus 
            it’s such a flavorful sauce so it doesn’t even require marinating.

        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet or wok.</li>
            <li>
                Add Chicken and let cook (giving space between pieces) until slightly 
                browned on bottom then flip chicken pieces over and cook through.
            </li>
            <li>While the chicken is cooking whish together the teriyaki sauce mixture.</li>
            <li>
                Pour sauce into the skillet once the chicken is just nearly finished 
                cooking through and let the sauce cook and simmer until thickened.
            </li>
            <li>
                Easy as that! Serve it warm over brown or white rice with steamed veggies.

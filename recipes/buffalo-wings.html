        <p>
            So here is what I promise you: If you love perfectly 
            seasoned crispy buffalo wings, tossed in a classic spicy, buttery Buffalo Sauce with a tinge of sweetness, and you prefer to avoid the mess and 
            calories of deep frying, this is The One.
        </p>
        <p>
            These aren’t just “quite crispy but still not like they’ve been deep fried”. 
            These wings are seriously crispy. Read hundreds of testimonials from people who have tried it!

                    <li>5 teaspoons baking powder</li>

            <li>
                Sauce
                <ul>
                    <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup Frank's Original Red Hot Sauce</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp brown sugar</li>
                    <li>1/4 tsp kosher salt/cooking salt</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dry overnight (optional) – If you plan ahead, lay the wings on a rack on a rimmed baking tray and let them dry uncovered in the fridge overnight. Alternatively, pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 250°F/120°C (all oven types). Put one oven shelf in the lower quarter of the oven and one in the top quarter.</li>
            <li>Line the tray with foil. Put a rack on the tray then spray the rack with oil.</li>
            <li>Toss wings – Place the wings in a large bowl. Sprinkle over baking powder and salt. Use hands to toss well (or shake in ziplock bag) to coat wings evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake 30 minutes on low temp – Place the wings skin side up on the rack (ok if snug, they shrink). Bake on the lower shelf in the oven for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bake 40 minutes on high – Move the tray up to the higher shelf and turn the oven up to 425°F / 220°C (all oven types). Bake for a further 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the tray halfway through. The wings do not need to be turned over. They are ready when dark golden brown and the skin is very crispy.</li>
            <li>Toss in sauce – Transfer the wings into a large bowl. Pour over sauce and toss to coat. (Alternatively, serve wings plain with Buffalo Sauce for dipping).</li>
        </ol>
